# Main Problems Encountered

**Problem 1**

- Description: The same as in the last sprint, issues depended on each other.
- Reaction: Some tasks could not be completed, because they depended on others to be done.

**Problem 2**

- Description: Work started too late, a couple of days before the end of the sprint.
- Reaction: Merge requests were chaotic, code review could not be done properly.


## Adjustments for next Sprint Plan

- I think setting deadlines for issue and actually following them will help those who have to build upon the work of others.
- Sprint planning has to be done more carefully, issues should be present from the first day of the sprint, so that anyone can start working on them the following day.

# Main Problems Encountered

**Problem 1**

- Description: Setting up the Eureka server is just in its infancy. There seems to be some error in the connections. This could be a problem from the dependencies.
- Reaction: This set up has to be completed. At least we were able to set-up and run the Eureka Server. More has to be developed in the coming days

**Problem 2**

- Description: Now that we are aware of the architecture, we have to set up our structure and determine what should correspond as a micro service and what not.
- Reaction: Group planning and careful infrastructure review



## Adjustments for next Sprint Plan

- So far the team has reacted well, we now have to shift our focus on the infrastructure so that we can plan better what each micro service will need, and how to coordinate communication within each micro service
- We also need to determine what corresponds as a micro service or not.

# Main Problems Encountered

**Problem 1**
- Description: Different teams were working on different microservices, and not all conventions were established beforehand.
- Reaction: There is a bit of inconsistency between different microservers. Nonetheless, they work together just fine.


## Adjustments for next Sprint Plan
- I believe planning went better than in previous weeks, but we can still improve. Perhaps more communication and more careful planning before coding will help.
